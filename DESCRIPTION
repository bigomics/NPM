Description: 'NPmatch' (Nereast Pair matching) achieves batch effects correction in omics data by performing distance-based matching to deterministically search, for each sample, the nearest k neighbors with opposite phenotype group label (so called 'nearest-pair'). NPmatch enables full dataset matching: all available samples are matched to k samples in the other phenotype group(s). No samples are dropped or removed from the datasets. NPmatch requires knowledge of the phenotypes but not of the batch assignment. The output is a matrix free of unwanted effects (i.e., batch-related variables) and so suitable for further analyses.
