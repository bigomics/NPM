Description: 'NPmatch' (Nereast Pair matching) achieves batch effects correction in omics data by performing distance-based matching. For each sample, NPmatch performs a search of the the nearest k neighbors with opposite phenotype group label -so called 'nearest-pair'. NPmatch enables full dataset matching: all available samples are matched to k samples in the other phenotype group(s). No samples are dropped or removed from the datasets. NPmatch requires knowledge of the phenotypes but not of the batch assignment. The output is a batch-corrected dataset suitable for further analyses.
