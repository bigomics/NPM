\title{Normalize Data}
\usage{
normalize.log2CPM(X, total = 1e+06, prior = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{raw data matrix (i.e., gene expression dataset): rows are features/genes; columns are samples.}

\item{total}{total count within each sample}

\item{prior}{offset integer added prior log transformation}
}
\value{
A matrix of log2-transformed counts per million (CPM) normalized expression data.
  The returned matrix has the same dimensions as the input matrix X, with genes as rows
  and samples as columns. Values are log2(CPM + prior) where CPM is calculated by
  normalizing each sample to the target total count (default 1e6).
